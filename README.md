## 🧩 Detailed Feature Descriptions

### Batch Processing of EDF Files
- **Open Folder with EDF Files**: The application allows you to select a folder containing EDF files for further processing. Once a folder is selected, all other features become available.
- **Rename EDF Files**: Files are renamed based on metadata extracted from the EDF files. The filename is generated using the patient's name and recording date.
- **Remove Corrupted Files**: The application checks each EDF file for integrity. If a file is corrupted, it is deleted from the folder.
- **Remove Duplicates**: The application searches for duplicate files by comparing their content (hash values). All duplicates, except one, are deleted.
- **Find Files with Similar Start Time**: The application finds files with recording start times that differ by no more than 10 minutes.
- **Generate Statistics**: The application collects statistics on all EDF files in the folder, including gender distribution, age distribution, and recording duration.
- **Create Patient Table**: A CSV file is generated containing patient information, including name, gender, and age at the time of recording.
- **Randomize Filenames**: Filenames are replaced with random 6-digit numeric codes. A mapping of old to new filenames is saved in a CSV file.
- **Remove Patient Info**: Patient information is removed from the EDF file headers while preserving UUID, gender, and birthdate.
- **Read EDF File Info**: The application displays detailed information about the selected EDF file, including patient name, gender, birthdate, recording date, recording duration, and channel list.

### Segmentation of EDF Files
- **Load EDF File**: Load an EDF file for segmentation.
- **Split EDF File**: Split the EDF file into segments based on events. The minimum segment duration can be configured.
- **Set Minimum Segment Duration**: Define the minimum duration for segments (default is 5 seconds).

### Database management
- **Create DB**: Creates a new SQLite database in the `DB` folder and automatically generates the table structure (patients, edf_files, segments, diagnosis). Automatically connects if the DB already exists.
- ***Fill***: Adds current segments to the database. Automatically links segments to files and patients. Saves: paths to segment files, start/end timestamps, event markers.
- ***DB Stats***: Shows a summary of the database.
- **Editor**: Visual interface for viewing tables.
- ***All Split & Fill***: Segments all EDF files in the folder and fills the DB.

## 🖥️ Interface

### Output Field
At the bottom of the interface, there is an output field where the results of operations are displayed. You can copy text from this field using:
- **Ctrl+C** — Copy selected text.
- **Ctrl+A** — Select all text.
- **Right-click** — Open a context menu for copying.
